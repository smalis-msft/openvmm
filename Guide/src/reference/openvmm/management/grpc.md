# gRPC / ttrpc

To enable a gRPC or ttrpc management interface, pass `--rpc`. This spawns an
OpenVMM process acting as an RPC server on the given Unix socket:

```bash
--rpc path=/path/to/openvmm.sock[,transport=<TRANSPORT>]
```

`transport` selects which wire protocol the server accepts:

* `auto` (default) — auto-detect ttrpc vs. gRPC per connection
* `ttrpc` — accept ttrpc clients only
* `grpc` — accept gRPC clients only

For example, to accept ttrpc clients only:

```bash
--rpc path=/path/to/openvmm.sock,transport=ttrpc
```

Here is a list of supported RPCs:

```admonish note title="API reference"
The API continues to evolve, and compatibility between releases is not
guaranteed. The [`vmservice.proto`] file is the authoritative API definition.
The list below summarizes the available RPCs; some definitions may be added
before their implementation is connected end to end.
```

* CreateVM
* TeardownVM
* PauseVM
* ResumeVM
* WaitVM
* CapabilitiesVM
* PropertiesVM
* ModifyResource
* AddPcieDevice
* RemovePcieDevice
* AddVpciDevice
* RemoveVpciDevice
* Quit

`AddVpciDevice` dynamically exposes a PCI device to VTL0 over Hyper-V VPCI.
The VM must have Hyper-V enlightenments and VMBus enabled, and the host
hypervisor backend must support virtual devices. The caller supplies the
guest-visible instance ID in `AddVpciDeviceRequest.instance_id` and uses the
same ID for `RemoveVpciDevice`. The response is empty. Removing an unknown
or previously removed instance ID returns an error.

Unlike `AddPcieDevice`, VPCI does not require a root complex or a predeclared
hotplug-capable PCIe port. `AddPcieDevice` remains available when standard PCIe
hotplug semantics or a non-VPCI host backend is required.
